# CP Repository

The purpose of this repository is to document my solutions for all competitive programming problems I have solved, displaying my growth in competitive programming step by step.

## üìÇ Directory Structure

- **`binarySearch_lowerAndUpperBound`** - Implementations of binary search and related functions like lower and upper bound.
- **`contests`** - Solutions to problems from different programming contests.
- **`numberTheory1`** - Fundamental number theory algorithms used in competitive programming (sieve algorithm, prime factorization).
- **`prefix_partial_2ptr`** - Algorithms related to prefix sums, partial sums, and two-pointer techniques.
- **`tr/numTheory1`** - Additional number theory implementations.
- **`unspecified_problems`** - Solutions to problems that don't fit into the above categories.

## üìå Topics Covered

1. Prefix Sum, Partial Sum, Two-Pointer Approach
2. Binary Search (Lower and Upper Bound)
3. Number Theory (GCD, Modular Arithmetic, Prime Factorization, Sieve)
