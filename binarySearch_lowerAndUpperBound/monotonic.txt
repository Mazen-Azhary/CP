monotonocity is a concept where array values being sorted leads to a certain condition being true in one consecutive 
part of array only

for example if we have an array 1 5 19 22 24 30 50 

say we are searching for a value 22 
so if we say from left to right , in each index ask a question : could the value be on my right ? (bigger than me)

T T T F F F F 
this is called always non decreasing:first true

the opposite happens if we ask the question in reverse so it's 

F F T T T T T 

this is called always non increasing:last true
