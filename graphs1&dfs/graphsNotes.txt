adjacency matrix n*n , max fits if n=1e6
adjacency list could be used but make it vector of sets instead of vector of vectors ,
set search complexity is O(logn) 

the tree is considered a special case of graphs
it's an undirected acyclic graph 
it has a special node called root which is the top/starting node of the tree
each node has a level 
root is at lvl 0 

node level is defined as number of edges between a node and root 
each node has 1 parent only , and some children , siblings , uncles , grandfathers 

if u have n nodes , then u always have n-1 edges , because root doesn't have a parent 

so for each node other than root we have an edge connecting it to its parent , so #edges is n-1 .

Complete graph : 
it's a graph which has n nodes and n(n-1)/2 edges , because each node is connected to 
all other nodes

هي n*(n-1)/2 
لان الطريق الواحد من دول رايح جي فا عشان كدا ظهرت ال/2 
و كل نود طالع منها n-1 
ايدجز للباقي كلهم

Bipartite Graph : 
it's a graph where we have red nodes and blue nodes , or set1 nodes and set2 nodes
such as each and every edges connect red to blue or set1 to set2 , any two same color nodes
can't have a direct edge connecting them. 

Bipartite graphs don't have odd cycles (cycles of length=oddNum)
it has cycles of length 4,6,8,....
