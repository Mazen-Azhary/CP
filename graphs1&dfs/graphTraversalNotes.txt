DFS can be written in recursive or iterative way 
but recursive in graphs is easier 

DFS (depth first search)
as long as u have adjacent non-visited nodes , visit them 

for ex our graph is 

2 ---- 4 ---- 1  
| \    /\     /
|  \  /  \   /
3    0---- 5  

start from 1 , visit 4 or 5 , let's choose 4 and mark 4 as visited
then from 4 , we have 1(visited),0,2,5(unvisited) , choose 5 and mark as visited
from 5 , we have 1,4(visited) and 0 unvisited , we choose 0 compulsory
.............

visit order : 1 4 5 0 2 3

DFS complexity is O( n + m )
the total operations i did where recursively calling n nodes , and the total num of edges I iterate on
is about O(m) but in reality it is a little bit bigger than m ,O(m) assumes each edge is explored once
